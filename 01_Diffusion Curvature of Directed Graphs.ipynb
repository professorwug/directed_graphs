    "# Porting Diffusion Curvature to Directed Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let us address the obvious question: *what does curvature mean in a directed graph?* Dislodged from the comfortable basis of a Riemannian manifold, we are adrift from our classical intuitions. At most, directed graphs might be used to model flow on a manifold; but many directed graphs (like social networks) have no analog to a manifold, and hence no classical notions of curvature to rest upon.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the same, there are indications of curvature in networks which we can stand upon to build intuition:\n",
    "1. *Communities*: We should expect communities to exhibit positive curvature. Rays traced between friend groups should tend to converge, and resonate within the group (hence the phenomenon of the echo chamber).\n",
    "2. Influence: People of high influence within a social network.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will document the effort to port Diffusion Curvature to directed graphs."

    "# Diffusion Curvature\n",
    "The chief difference between diffusion curvature in the directed graphs setting And the regular seven is the adjacency matrix of a directed graph is a symmetric. However, nothing about diffusion curvature requires symmetry, hence we must simply be a little careful with the definition of the diffusion matrix, taking pains not to divide by zero during normalization. This is handled by the diffusion matrix function in `utils.py`. Thus, we need only provide a wrapper around the diffusion curvature function in the `diffusion_curvature` package."
